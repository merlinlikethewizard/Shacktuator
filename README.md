# Shacktuator
A ComputerCraft turtle house randomizer and builder.
Robot villages in Minecraft are now possible! With each turtle customizing its own domicile, the possibilities are endless.

Also comes with the merlib library, full of useful functions (currently undocumented).

To use in an advanced mining turtle:
```
> pastebin get F6YiMAvu package
> package
> rm package
> shacktuator
```
